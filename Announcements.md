## Welcome to CMSE802


Hello CMSE802 students,

I am excited to be teaching CMSE802 this Fall and look forward to meeting all of you in class this week. Detailed information about the course, including the syllabus, schedule and assignments can be found on the course website (Bookmark this page!):

- [CMSE802 Course Website](http://cmse.msu.edu/CMSE802)

We will be using Jupyter notebooks for quite a bit of our student/instructor communication. Please come to class with the latest version of Anaconda Python installed (Anaconda includes Jupyter). Instructions for installing and using Anaconda and Jupyter can be found here:

- [0000--Jupyter-Getting-Started-Guide.html](https://msu-cmse-courses.github.io/cmse802-f20-student/0000--Jupyter-Getting-Started-Guide.html)

This semester we will be teaching using a remote/synchronous teaching model. This means class will meet at the designated time on the schedule. During class, the instructor will also be broadcasting the lecture for you to log-in and participate remotely and the zoom session will also be recorded/edited and posted on-line for asynchronous review. Please use the following zoom url when attending class:

All students will be expected to participate in class activities for which there will also be asynchronous options if you are in a different time zone or are having temporary technical issues. However, the easiest way to ensure getting credit for participation is to attend class live. I will need a sufficient number of students to engage in the live discussion in order for everyone to get the most out of the activities. If this becomes a problem we may need to revisit class policies later in the semester.

If you have any questions about CMSE802, please do not hesitate to contact your section instructors listed in the syllabus on the course website. 

Take care,

- Dr. Dirk Colbry
